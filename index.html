            <h3>As travelers seek new and different experiences, adventure tourism continues to grow in popularity. Adventure tourism, according to the Adventure Travel Trade Association, is a tourist activity that includes physical activity, a cultural exchange,
                or activities in nature. You don't necessarily have to go base jumping or go scuba diving with sharks to be an adventure tourist (although those activities definitely qualify). Adventure tourism is about connecting with a new culture or
                a new landscape and being physically active at the same time. It is not about being risky or pushing your boundaries. In fact, it is especially important to know and respect your limits while you are in an unfamiliar area. Our list of
                adventure tourism activities has plenty of options if you aren't necessarily a thrill seeker. If you are an adrenaline junkie, don't worry we still have a few ideas for your next trip.

            <h3>If you are more adventurous and have the proper equipment, you can extend your day hike into a backpacking trip. Backpacking allows you to stay out in nature longer and see more things than you would on a normal day hike. It is important to
                have the proper survival knowledge and gear. If you haven't backpacked before, make sure that you go with someone knowledgeable that will show you the proper backpacking techniques. The Gore Range Trail is a great way to explore the mountains
                outside Silverthorne, Colorado. The whole trail is 41.7 miles long and is rated as a difficult trail. The scenic views make it worth the effort. If you're not up for the full hike, you can set a goal for reaching one of the high alpine
                lakes along the trail.</h3>

            <h3>Climbing is a classic example of an adventure tourism activity. It combines physical activity and allows you to take in the beauty of nature. Even if you've never climbed a day in your life, you can still get up a rock wall with the help of
                a guide. Make sure to check the safety record and accreditations of your rock climbing guide before heading out! Another option is to try climbing indoors. Many cities have rock climbing gyms so you can easily access some adventure! Ask
                if they have TRUBLUE Auto Belays so you can walk in and start climbing without needing an introductory class.</h3>

            <h3>Floating down a cool river on a hot summer day can be an excellent way to explore a new area. You get all the excitement of battling a rapid and you can also sit back and enjoy the view during the calmer sections of the river. The best season
                for rafting usually depends on the area you're in and your desired level of adventure. Generally speaking, the water levels are usually higher earlier in the season and lower later in the season. Higher water levels provide bigger rapids
                and more thrills, while lower levels are more subdued.</h3>

            <h3>You might not have realized that your annual family ski trip qualifies as adventure tourism. Cruising down the slopes at a resort keeps you active and lets you experience the outdoors. The western United States is known for its exceptional
                skiing up and down the Rocky Mountains. You'll find fresh powder and amazing slopes all the way from Alaska down to Utah, Colorado and even northern New Mexico. If you're the adventurous type, you can abandon the resorts and set out into
                the backcountry. Backcountry skiing can be extremely dangerous if you aren't properly trained. It's absolutely necessary to take an avalanche safety class and buy all the proper safety equipment before you go off-piste. Consider hiring
                guide services for your first time trying backcountry skiing or snowboarding.</h3>
